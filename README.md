# dadaGUI
A graphical user interface for the DADA2 amplicon sequencing pipeline by @benjjneb

These scripts are meant to provide a graphical user interface (GUI) for users with limited experience with the R environment. All R scripts are callable from the commandline to minimise user interaction with R code. Furthermore, there is a Python script implementing a tkinter GUI that calls the R scripts after user inputs have been given in the interface.

Please, refer to the DADA2 documentation at https://benjjneb.github.io/dada2/index.html for detailled information about the denoising pipeline itself.

A documentation for the provided convenience scripts can be found in the provided documentation file.
