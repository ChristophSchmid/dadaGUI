# dadaGUI
A graphical user interface for the DADA2 amplicon sequencing pipeline by @benjjneb

These scripts are meant to provide a graphical user interface (GUI) for users with limited experience with the R environment. All R scripts are callable from the commandline to minimise user interaction with R code. Furthermore, there is a Python script implementing a simple tkinter GUI that calls the R scripts after user inputs have been given in the interface.

The scripts have not been generalised yet, especially file paths used by the script still need a workaround.
